# ModelViewer Component Improvements

## Overview of Changes

The ModelViewer component has been completely rewritten to address memory leaks, performance issues, and improve overall user experience. The key improvements include:

### 1. Memory Leak Prevention

- **Proper Cleanup**: Implemented a comprehensive cleanup system that properly removes event listeners, clears intervals/timeouts, and releases references when the component unmounts.
- **Reference Management**: Added a centralized cleanup function registry that ensures all resources are properly released.
- **isMounted Pattern**: Used a ref to track the mounted state to prevent state updates after component unmount.

### 2. Lazy Loading Implementation

- **Intersection Observer**: Added an Intersection Observer to detect when the component is visible in the viewport.
- **Conditional Loading**: The 3D model and related resources are only loaded when the component becomes visible.
- **Placeholder Display**: Shows a lightweight placeholder when the component is not visible, reducing memory usage.

### 3. TypeScript Integration

- **Proper Type Definitions**: Added TypeScript interfaces for component props and proper type annotations for all variables.
- **DOM Element Types**: Added specific types for DOM element references.
- **Event Handling Types**: Improved type safety for event handlers and callbacks.

### 4. Performance Optimizations

- **Memoized Callbacks**: Used useCallback for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Optimized DOM Manipulation**: Minimized direct DOM manipulation and improved cleanup.
- **Controlled Resource Loading**: Only loads the script and model when necessary.

### 5. Error Handling and Fallbacks

- **Enhanced Error States**: Improved error handling with more descriptive messages.
- **Device Compatibility Fallbacks**: Added fallback content for devices that don't support WebGL.
- **Graceful Degradation**: The component now gracefully handles errors and provides useful feedback.

### 6. Accessibility Improvements

- **ARIA Labels**: Added proper aria-labels to interactive elements.
- **Semantic HTML**: Improved the semantic structure of the component.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Controls are now properly accessible via keyboard.

## Testing Notes

To verify the improvements, the following should be tested:

1. Load and unload the component multiple times to ensure no memory leaks
2. Test on devices with limited GPU capabilities
3. Test with network throttling to verify error states
4. Check performance when multiple instances are on the page
5. Verify that models only load when scrolled into view

## Future Improvements

While the current implementation addresses the critical issues, future improvements could include:

1. Add detection for device capabilities to automatically adjust model quality
2. Implement a model caching system to improve loading performance
3. Add support for progressive loading of models
4. Create a lightweight 2D fallback for very limited devices
