# ModelViewer Component Issues and Improvement Areas

## Current Issues

The `components/model-viewer.tsx` component has several issues:

1. **Memory Leaks**:
   - Inadequate cleanup in useEffect hooks
   - Repeated mounting/unmounting causes WebGL crashes
   - Script and event listeners are not properly removed

2. **Implementation Problems**:
   - Direct DOM manipulation which can be error-prone
   - Adding scripts to document.head which may conflict with CSP
   - Inefficient handling of the Google Model Viewer library loading

3. **Performance Issues**:
   - No lazy loading for models
   - Models load even when not in the viewport
   - No optimization for mobile devices with limited GPU

## Improvement Opportunities

1. **Proper Cleanup**:
   - Implement complete cleanup function in useEffect
   - Remove event listeners properly
   - Release WebGL contexts when component unmounts

2. **Lazy Loading**:
   - Implement Intersection Observer to load models only when visible
   - Use React.lazy and Suspense for component-level code splitting
   - Add loading states for better user experience

3. **Fallbacks**:
   - Add proper fallback for devices without WebGL support
   - Create a simplified version for mobile devices
   - Handle loading errors gracefully

4. **Code Structure**:
   - Use React refs more effectively
   - Improve typing for the component and its props
   - Separate model loading logic from rendering logic

## Example of Problematic Code

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Script is added to head but never removed
  const script = document.createElement("script")
  script.src = "https://unpkg.com/@google/model-viewer@v3.0.2/dist/model-viewer.min.js"
  script.type = "module"
  document.head.appendChild(script)

  return () => {
    // No cleanup function to remove script
  }
}, [])
```

## Potential Solutions

1. Use a more React-friendly approach to load the script
2. Implement proper cleanup for all resources
3. Use a ref to track mounted state and prevent memory leaks
4. Add throttling for intensive operations
5. Implement more optimized loading strategies
